# Hello World for SwiftGL

This is a package for the open source Swift. Usage:

- Install [GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/) version 3.
- In this folder, execute:
- `swift build`
- `.build/debug/hello`

It's just a box. You need to use all the interesting OpenGL command
patterns to draw a box. So you'll find everything you need to figure
out how Swift exchanges data with OpenGL.
